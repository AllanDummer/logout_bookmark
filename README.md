# logout_bookmark
Experiment. It works in my environment. Needs further testing.

 A simple Drupal module that will remember the page URL a user is viewing
 when a "logout" (/?q=logout) link is clicked and, upon subsequent login will
 take them back to that page.
 
 Written to be used with Quiz/Cource modules but it can be
 extended to other areas as well. Right now it does a custom job.
 
 Base code/idea came from https://gist.github.com/santyr/1155428 - Thanks
